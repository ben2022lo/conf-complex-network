# conf-complex-network

## implementation
The V0 consist our first algorithm which is not pertinet for the structure of simplificial complex.
The V1, based on V0's core algorithm, would call for lead-lag transformation and construct valid simplificial complex.

## dataset 
We have used the daily prices of 119 NYSE stocks for the period spanning from 1999-12-31 to 2021-06-17.
We will try resting-state fMRI signals of the 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, http://www.humanconnectome.org/), where the interactions between TS are known.
